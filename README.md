This repo is used to hold all my Python files that I have created for pulling data from various UN repositories getting data on partners, activities and then map. 
For my project on Operational data portal data migration, I had to map various content such as documents, coordination content, documents and operational populationd data and then link with their identifies.
I have done all the mapping using Python. I also did some scrappning pulling partenrs data and then mappaed against the documents in ODP so that it can be ingested in the enterprise data lake.
